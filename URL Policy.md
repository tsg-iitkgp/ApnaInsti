# Organizational URL Policy of ApnaInsti

Note: all further discussion will refer to an organization/club/independent body as a "body", and the same URL policy is applicable to all bodies. All URLs in ApnaInsti are decided by canonical names of bodies. Each body is assigned a canonical name on creation, which decides the URL of the body. Hence, this policy directly pertains to assignment of the canonical name for a body.

All names of organizations used in this document are for the purpose of illustration only, and have no bearing on any particular cases/bodies

Some of the conditions that a canonical name of the body should satisfy are listed as follows:

1. The canonical name should be representative of the name of the body. For example, "Spring Fest" and "SF" are valid examples of canonical names, "Kshitij" and "Hello World" are not.
2. The canonical name should not be abbreviated unless the abbreviation is used in branding for the body, or is a commonly recognized short name.
3. The canonical name should not contain special characters, and it should not contain numbers unless they are a part of the name of the body.
4. All clubs not referred to by abbreviations must have the word "Club" in the canonical name. For example, "TLS" is a valid canonical name; "Literary Club" is not.
5. The canonical name may not contain a description of the body. For example, "DebSoc" is a valid canonical name; "DebSoc - The Debating Society" is not.
6. The canonical name may not contain the name of the instutute, unless it is a part of the name of the organization. For example, "DebSoc", "SPATs" and "TLS" are valid, "SPATs of IIT Kharagpur" is not.
7. Two bodies having the same valid canonical name will be handled with the body higher in the tree hierarcy given preference, and the number of followers the bodies currently have on [ApnaInsti](INSERT_URL) as a tie breaker. This clause may be relaxed on a case to case basis

The decision of whether a URL or canonical name violates the Organizational URL policy will taken by the ApnaInsti team and shall be binding. You may submit an appeal to reconsider with an explanation as to why the change is necessary in case your request is denied.
